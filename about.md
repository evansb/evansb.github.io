I am an undergraduate student from [NUS School of Computing][1].
As such, I currently resides in Singapore though I originally hail from
a small town of [Blitar, Indonesia][2].

My major is computer science with focus in programming Languages and
software engineering. I am passionate about functional programming and
programming language implementation. Being a language geek, I've written 
codes in various languages ranging from Javascript to Coq.

### Work Experience

#### Undergraduate Research Intern (NUS, Summer 2015)
Spent 2.5 months working on [HIP/SLEEK][3], a software system 
built to verify the correctness of heap manipulating program using separation
logic. It is a huge OCaml codebase with over several hundreds thousands lines
of code. As an undergraduate intern, I get to work in pair with a PhD student
to help implementing Immutability Annotation Inference for Heap Variables.
I also refactored and fixed several issues on its pretty printing module.

I also tried to implement a distributed testing suite for HIP/SLEEK in Scala using
Akka framework, though the program is unfinished and is taken over by
another guy.

#### Teaching Assistant (NUS, Fall 2015)
Taught [CS1101S Programming Methodology][4], which is a freshman programming
course in NUS. It is a course based on MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of
Interpretation Program, though the language used is Javascript.

### Notable Projects

#### Jediscript Runtime System

[Bitbucket][5]

Maintained a runtime system which comprises compiler and virtual machine for Jediscript, a
 subset of Javascript used in NUS to teach CS1101S. 

#### FoodFlow

[Link to App][6]

Worked as frontend developer on Foodflow, a company food ordering as a service.

In this project I get to dabble with modern javascript stack such as React and Redux.

#### Space

Space is a general purpose web based workspace that supports collaborative editing via
widgets.
